# Title of the Project:
Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives

# Description of Project:
Our website aims to reorganize and present the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives in a more structured and visually appealing manner, making it easier for the public and stakeholders to identify and be on the lookout for these fugitives.

# Description of Target Browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones?):
Our website was built for computers/laptops. The target browser used in the process was Google Chrome.

# Developer Manual:
Install dependencies (do this after you clone the repo): npm i
Start the web application: npm start
Stop the web application: CTRL + C in your terminal

# Comments:
We ran into some issues with the API not providing valid images of the fugitives. Some images of fugitives may not pop up because of the API issue.
