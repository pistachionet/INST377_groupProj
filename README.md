Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives

Our website aims to reorganize and present the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives in a more structured and visually appealing manner, making it easier for the public and stakeholders to identify and be on the lookout for these fugitives.

# Description of Target Browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones?):
Our website was built for computers/laptops. The target browser used in the process was Google Chrome.

# Developer Manual:

# Comments:
We ran into some issues with the API not providing valid images of the fugitives. Some images of fugitives may not pop up because of the API issue.
